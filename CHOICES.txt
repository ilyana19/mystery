CHOICES

First Choice: Stick with the PB&J your mom packed you. You're really looking forward to those Hip Tunes.
Second Choice: Get to work helping. Take a look around the room. Look for people and things that look suspicious or stand out. The sooner begun, the sooner done.
Third Choice: Approach Helga and the Doctor.
Fourth Choice: Talk to them directly.
Fifth Choice: Approach Billy.

6) Talk to Billy directly.
7) Approach Danny.
8) You've seen enough. Danny's clearly guilty! Taking out the trash? Cleaning up the mess? Come on. Accuse Danny.
8) Accuse Billy Binary.
8) Accuse Helga Hex.
